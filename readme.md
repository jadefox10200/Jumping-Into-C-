#JUMPING INTO C++ <br>

This is a summary of my study of this book by Alex Allain. I give a very brief
description of each chapter and what date I finished the chapter. Figured
this would be much better than any amazon review I could write. <br>

##Chapter One: Introduction and Developer Environment Setup <br>
All that this chapter covers is the developer environment. I've chosen to use
atom as my text editor and use the g++ hello.cpp -o hello to compile files.
While I do have Xcode, I don't like it and prefer my Atom editor.

Finished, Oct 5 2016.


##Chapter Two: The Basics of C++ <br>
This teaches basic text line reading and the concept of file headers along with
commenting. Completed the quiz and the practice programs.

Finished, Oct 5 2016.

##Chapter Three: User Interaction and Working with Variables <br>
Teaches basics of getting input from the user as well as variable declaration.
Covers the basic types (double, char, int) and basic arithmetic operators.
At one point shows the getline() function and even covers it as a quiz question.
However, it doesn't show a full example and is not clear how to use it.
